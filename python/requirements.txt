# Terminal Instructions for sci-paper-rag

## 1. Activate the Python Virtual Environment
```sh
cd /Users/hesamandalib/Desktop/265Project/VO2maxApp/Vo2maxApp/sci-paper-rag
source venv/bin/activate
```

## 2. Install Required Python Packages
```sh
pip install streamlit unstructured pdfminer.six pi-heif
```

## 3. Run the Streamlit PDF Extraction App
```sh
streamlit run python/pdf_to_jsonl_app.py
```

## 4. If You See a "ModuleNotFoundError"
- Read the error message for the missing module.
- Install it with:
  ```sh
  pip install <missing-package-name>
  ```
- Then restart the app.

## 5. Stop the Streamlit App
- In the terminal running the app, press `Ctrl+C`.
- Or close the terminal tab/window.

That’s an **excellent idea**—and a very practical workaround!

If your research PDFs are mostly text-based (not scanned images), you can **disable OCR** in the `partition_pdf` call. This will:
- Avoid the need for Tesseract and OCR setup.
- Make extraction faster and less error-prone for digital PDFs.

---

## **How to Do It**

**In your `pdf_to_jsonl_app.py`, change:**
```python
elements = partition_pdf(input_pdf)
```
**to:**
```python
elements = partition_pdf(input_pdf, infer_table_structure=False, ocr_strategy="none")
```

- `ocr_strategy="none"` disables OCR completely.
- `infer_table_structure=False` avoids table OCR as well.

---

## **What Will Happen**
- The app will only extract text from PDFs that already have embedded text.
- If you upload a scanned PDF (image-only), it will not extract any text from those pages.

---

## **Add to Your Instruction File**

```markdown
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```

---

**Try this change and restart your Streamlit app.**  
If it works, you can always re-enable OCR later if you need it for scanned documents.

Let me know if this solves the issue!
