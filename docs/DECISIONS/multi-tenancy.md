# 📋 Decision Record: Multi-Tenant Architecture

## 🎯 **Decision**

We chose to implement a **multi-tenant architecture** for the Sci-Paper RAG system instead of a single-tenant approach.

## 📅 **Date**

December 2024

## 👥 **Decision Makers**

- Development Team
- Project Stakeholders

## 🔍 **Context**

The Sci-Paper RAG system needs to serve multiple users/organizations, each with their own:
- PDF documents and research papers
- Vector embeddings and chunks
- Chat conversations and settings
- Embeddable widgets for their websites

## 🚀 **Options Considered**

### **Option 1: Single-Tenant (Rejected)**
- **Description**: One database instance per user/organization
- **Pros**: Complete data isolation, simple security model
- **Cons**: Higher infrastructure costs, complex deployment, scaling challenges
- **Why Rejected**: Overkill for our use case, expensive to maintain

### **Option 2: Multi-Tenant with Shared Database (Chosen)**
- **Description**: Single database with user-scoped data isolation
- **Pros**: Cost-effective, easier scaling, simpler deployment
- **Cons**: More complex security implementation, potential for data leakage if not properly implemented
- **Why Chosen**: Best balance of security, cost, and scalability

### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Considered)**
- **Description**: Mix of shared and dedicated resources
- **Pros**: Flexibility, can optimize based on user needs
- **Cons**: Increased complexity, harder to maintain
- **Why Rejected**: Unnecessary complexity for our current requirements

## ✅ **Chosen Solution: Multi-Tenant with Shared Database**

### **Implementation Details**
- **Database**: Single Supabase instance with user-scoped tables
- **Isolation**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all tables
- **Authentication**: User-based access control with UUID scoping
- **Data Separation**: `user_id` foreign key on all user-specific tables

### **Security Measures**
- **Row Level Security**: Enabled on all tables
- **User Scoping**: All queries filtered by `auth.uid()`
- **Function Security**: `SECURITY DEFINER` functions with user validation
- **API Scoping**: All endpoints require user authentication

## 🏗️ **Architecture Impact**

### **Database Schema**
```sql
-- All tables include user_id for isolation
CREATE TABLE pdf_chunks (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  -- ... other fields
);

-- RLS policies ensure user isolation
CREATE POLICY "Users can only access own chunks" 
ON pdf_chunks FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### **API Design**
- All endpoints require user authentication
- User context extracted from JWT token
- Database queries automatically scoped to user
- No cross-user data access possible

### **Frontend Architecture**
- User-specific dashboards and views
- User-scoped data fetching
- Widget embedding with user-specific keys
- User settings and preferences

## 📊 **Benefits**

### **Cost Efficiency**
- Single database instance serves all users
- Shared infrastructure costs
- Easier to scale and maintain

### **Security**
- Complete data isolation between users
- No possibility of cross-user data access
- Audit trail for all user actions

### **Scalability**
- Easy to add new users
- Shared resources can be optimized
- Simple backup and maintenance procedures

### **Development**
- Single codebase to maintain
- Consistent user experience
- Easier to implement global features

## 🚨 **Risks & Mitigation**

### **Risk: Data Leakage**
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive RLS policies, thorough testing
- **Monitoring**: Regular security audits, access logging

### **Risk: Performance Impact**
- **Mitigation**: Proper indexing, query optimization
- **Monitoring**: Performance metrics, query analysis

### **Risk: Complex Security Model**
- **Mitigation**: Clear security patterns, comprehensive testing
- **Documentation**: Detailed security implementation guides

## 🔄 **Future Considerations**

### **Scaling Strategy**
- Monitor database performance as user count grows
- Consider read replicas for high-traffic scenarios
- Implement connection pooling for optimal performance

### **Feature Evolution**
- User-specific customization options
- Advanced permission systems (if needed)
- Multi-user collaboration features

### **Compliance Requirements**
- GDPR compliance for European users
- Data residency requirements
- Industry-specific compliance needs
