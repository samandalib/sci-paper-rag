  - **RAG Settings**: User instruction and system prompt configuration
  - **File Management**: PDF upload interface with progress tracking
  - **Chat Playground**: Real-time testing of RAG configuration
- **Responsive design** that works on all device sizes
- **File upload interface** with drag-and-drop support

### **4. API Infrastructure** ✅
- **User RAG Settings API** (`/api/user-rag-settings`) - Fully functional
- **User Documents API** (`/api/user-documents`) - Fully functional
- **PDF Upload API** (`/api/upload-pdf`) - **WORKING AND TESTED** ✅
- **API structure** established for remaining endpoints
- **Environment variable management** properly configured
- **Error handling** and validation implemented

### **5. File Upload & Storage** ✅
- **PDF upload functionality** working correctly
- **Supabase storage integration** successfully implemented
- **File validation** (PDF type, size limits) working
- **Database record creation** for uploaded files working
- **User isolation** ensuring files are properly scoped to users
- **Processing status tracking** implemented

### **6. Development Environment** ✅
- **Environment variables** properly configured and loading
- **Database connection** tested and working
- **Setup scripts** created and functional
- **Development server** running on port 3000
- **All dependencies** installed and configured

---

## 🔧 **Issues We Fixed**

### **1. PDF Upload 500 Error** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Problem**: Module-level code execution causing environment variable issues
- **Root Cause**: Supabase client initialization and storage bucket checks running before environment variables loaded
- **Solution**: Moved all initialization code inside the handler function

### **2. Database Record Creation Failure** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Problem**: "Failed to create database record" error
- **Root Cause**: Mock user ID didn't exist in the database
- **Solution**: Updated mock user ID to match actual test user in database

### **3. Environment Variable Loading** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Problem**: Setup scripts couldn't read environment variables
- **Root Cause**: Missing dotenv configuration
- **Solution**: Installed dotenv and configured proper loading

### **4. API Routing Issues** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Problem**: API endpoints returning 404 errors
- **Root Cause**: API files in wrong directory (`api/` instead of `pages/api/`)
- **Solution**: Moved API files to correct Next.js API routes directory

### **5. Import Path Issues** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Problem**: Module not found errors for PythonPDFProcessor
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect relative import paths after moving files
- **Solution**: Updated import paths to use correct relative paths

## 🎯 **Current Working Status**

### **✅ Fully Working Components**
- **PDF Upload**: Successfully uploads PDFs to Supabase storage
- **File Storage**: Files stored in `user-pdfs` bucket with proper isolation
- **Database Records**: Creates entries in `user_documents` table
- **API Endpoints**: All endpoints responding with 200 status
- **Frontend Integration**: Admin dashboard properly connected to APIs
- **File Validation**: PDF type and size validation working
- **Progress Tracking**: Upload progress indicators functional

### **🔄 Partially Working Components**
- **Python Processing Pipeline**: Started but encountering Blob/Buffer type issues
- **Text Extraction**: Framework ready, needs Blob handling fix
- **Processing Status**: Basic status tracking working

### **📋 Current Known Issues**
1. **Blob/Buffer Type Error**: Python processor receiving Blob instead of Buffer
   - **Error**: `The "data" argument must be of type string or an instance of Buffer, TypedArray, or DataView. Received an instance of Blob`
   - **Location**: `PythonPDFProcessor.saveTempPDF()` method
   - **Impact**: Prevents PDF processing from completing
